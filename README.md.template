# Rust serialization benchmark

The goal of these benchmarks is to provide thorough and complete benchmarks for various rust
serialization frameworks.

## These benchmarks are a work in progress

These benchmarks are still being developed and pull requests to improve benchmarks are welcome.

You can use [this horrible tiny webpage](https://davidkoloski.me/rust_serialization_benchmark) to
turn a benchmark log into nicely-formatted markdown tables.

## Format

All tests benchmark the following properties (time or size):

* **Serialize**: serialize data into a buffer
* **Deserialize**: deserializes a buffer into a normal rust object
* **Size**: the size of the buffer when serialized
* **Zlib**: the size of the buffer after zlib compression

Zero-copy deserialization libraries have an additional set of benchmarks:

* **Access**: accesses a buffer as structured data
* **Read**: runs through a buffer and reads fields out of it
* **Update**: updates a buffer as structured data

Some benchmark results may be italicized and followed by an asterisk. Mouse over these for more details on what situation was benchmarked. Other footnotes are located at the bottom.

† *do not provide deserialization capabilities, but the user can write their own*

‡ *do not support buffer mutation (`capnp` and `flatbuffers` may but not for rust)*
