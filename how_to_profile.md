# How to profile these benchmarks

## Windows

We'll be profiling these benchmarks with Visual Studio. Make sure you have basic C/C++ payloads
installed for it.

1. Add the following beneath the `[[bench]]` line in `Cargo.toml`:
   ```
   [profile.bench]
   debug = true
   ```
2. Build the benchmark without running it with `cargo bench --no-run`
3. Locate the benchmark binary at `target/release/deps/bench-*.exe`. If there are multiple `bench`
   executables in `deps`, you can determine which one is the most recent by deleting all of them and
   rebuilding.
4. Start Visual Studio and open a new project. Browse to the `.exe` location and open it.
5. Right click on the `bench-*` project in the Solution Explorer and select `Properties`.
6. Set the `Arguments` parameter to `--bench <FILTER>` where `<FILTER>` is the filter you would pass
   to `cargo bench -- <FILTER>`.
7. Save the project properties and select `Debug > Performance Profiler...`.
8. Check `CPU Usage` and click `Start`. The benchmarks will run and upon finishing the data will be
   analyzed.
9. Select the areas of the diagnostics session when your benchmark is running to analyze.

## Linux

With the "pprof" feature enabled, the Criterion benchmarking library can be used
to automatically output profiles with flamegraphs for each benchmark. Simply run
the desired benchmarks while passing `--profile-time=10` or similar to the
benchmark binary. (Passing this argument probably requires specifying the
"bench" benchmark specifically, as other test binaries that cargo thinks might
have benchmarks in them do not understand the flag.)

Example command: `cargo bench --bench bench --no-default-features --features fooencoder,pprof -- 'minecraft_savedata/fooencoder/serialize' --profile-time=10`

This will run the "minecraft_savedata/fooencoder/serialize" benchmark and
profile it, then save a flamegraph of the profile results as a `.svg` file to
`target/criterion/minecraft_savedata_fooencoder/serialize/profile/flamegraph.svg`.
